h1. ABOUT

These are simple Ruby scripts for use with D&D 4th Edition, specifically the Character Builder and D&D Insider. (These services are products of Wizards of the Coast; this tool is for personal use only.)

You can use these scripts to reprocess info here in whatever form you choose.

h1. INSTALL

Requires: rubygems, andand, nokogiri, mechanize.

h1. USAGE

ruby scripts/convert_all_characters.rb

  Processes scripts/input/*.dnd4e and outputs scripts/output/*.html with HTML-formatted character sheets. Includes a JS die-rolling facility.

ruby scripts/convert_all_characters.rb

  As above, but print-friendly and without the JS.

ruby scripts/create_party_summary.rb

  Processes scripts/input/*.dnd4e and outputs scripts/output/dnd-party.html, with the basic stats of all your PCs.

h2. Notes

  The scripts assume you will be viewing the files locally in their default position. If you are uploading the files to a server, you'll need to change "path_to_includes" in the scripts so that the pages can find the contents of /includes.

h1. Customzing Scripts

character.to_power_cards can take in a hash of options, as demonstrated in the sample scripts. Options include:

  :action_point => true # include a card for Action Point
  :second_wind => true # include a card for Second Wind
  :dice_js => false # disable the JS dice-rolling ability
